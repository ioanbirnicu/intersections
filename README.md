Rectangle Intersections
--------------------------

You can compile and run the code on a Linux platform using g++:
1. Compile using g++:
   g++ main.cpp utils.cpp Rectangle.cpp
   
2. Run program with the input file argument:
   ./a.out IO/input1.txt

3. See results in IO/output.txt.

On Windows, if you are using an IDE (Visual Studio, CodeLite etc), you can create a console application and add the files attached in the same folder.
You can also run the executable from the folder, as follows:
path_to_file>Nitro.exe inputFileName
